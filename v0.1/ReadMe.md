## TODOS:
# Emulator
- CPU flags arent fully working
- Try to rewrite stack ops to make them shoter using new BO and EOS ctrl lines

# Assembler
- Make list of instructions that need to be generated after label dependencies met (track address)
- Finish binary code generation (waiting on partial emulator rewrite)
- Figure out multi file assembly (linker?)
